# Lesson 10: SIEM Analytics & Threat Correlation Tutorial
## From Raw Data to Security Intelligence

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

### For Non-Technical Executives

**What Problem Are We Solving?**
Imagine your company has hundreds of security cameras (systems) recording everything that happens. Without analytics, your security team would have to watch all camera feeds simultaneously - an impossible task. SIEM analytics is like having a smart security system that automatically flags suspicious behavior and connects related events to detect complex threats.

**The Business Value:**
- **Early Threat Detection**: Spot attacks before they cause damage
- **Reduced Risk**: Proactively identify security gaps
- **Compliance**: Demonstrate security controls to auditors
- **Efficiency**: Automate security monitoring, reducing manual effort

**Simple Analogy:**
Think of SIEM analytics as a **smart home security system**:
- Individual sensors (door, window, motion) = Individual security logs
- Correlation engine = The brain that connects "door opened + motion detected + alarm disabled"
- Alerts = The system calling you saying "suspicious activity detected"
- Your Lesson 10 system = A working prototype of this smart security

## 🏗️ Technical Deep Dive

### For Cloud Security Architects

### Core Concepts Explained

#### 1. SIEM Analytics
**What it is**: The process of applying mathematical models and algorithms to security data to identify patterns, anomalies, and potential threats.

**Technical Implementation**:
```bash
# Our Lesson 10 Implementation:
./compute_metrics.sh decision_logs.jsonl
# Output: {"window": 50, "allow": 20, "deny": 30, "deny_ratio": 0.600}
Why it matters:

Baseline Establishment: Understand normal behavior patterns

Anomaly Detection: Identify deviations from established baselines

Trend Analysis: Spot emerging threats through pattern recognition

Risk Quantification: Assign numerical risk scores to activities

2. Threat Correlation
What it is: The process of connecting related security events across multiple systems and timeframes to identify complex attack patterns.

Technical Implementation:

bash
# Our correlation rule in alerts.sh:
THRESHOLD=0.60  # Alert if deny ratio > 60%
# This correlates multiple denied access attempts into a single threat indicator
Why it matters:

Attack Chain Identification: Connect reconnaissance, intrusion, and exfiltration attempts

Multi-Vector Detection: Spot attacks spanning users, systems, and time

Context Enrichment: Add meaning to isolated security events

False Positive Reduction: Separate real threats from noise

🔄 The SIEM Analytics Workflow
Step 1: Data Collection & Normalization
What Happens: Gather security events from across your environment

Our Implementation:

bash
# generate_events.sh collects from OPA policy decisions
# Output: JSONL format with standardized fields
{"ts":"2025-10-07T12:00:00-07:00","user":"ola","risk":25,"result":true}
Enterprise Equivalent:

Firewall logs

Cloud trail logs

Authentication systems

Application logs

Step 2: Analysis & Correlation
What Happens: Apply rules and algorithms to detect threats

Our Implementation:

bash
# compute_metrics.sh analyzes:
# - Rolling windows of events
# - Deny ratios
# - Per-user patterns
# - Statistical anomalies
Advanced Techniques:

UEBA (User Entity Behavior Analytics): Baseline normal user behavior

Machine Learning: Detect novel attack patterns

Threat Intelligence: Cross-reference with known bad actors

Step 3: Alerting & Prioritization
What Happens: Generate and rank security alerts

Our Implementation:

bash
# alerts.sh triggers when:
deny_ratio > THRESHOLD  # 60% in our case
# Output: 🚨 ALERT: Global deny_ratio 0.800 > 0.60
Enterprise Features:

Alert Fatigue Management: Only show high-priority alerts

Risk-Based Prioritization: Focus on critical assets

Automated Triage: Pre-investigate alerts before human review

Step 4: Investigation & Response
What Happens: Analyze and respond to security incidents

Our Implementation:

bash
# Manual investigation using:
./compute_metrics.sh  # Get current state
cat decision_logs.jsonl | jq .  # Examine raw events
Enterprise Capabilities:

Forensic Timeline: Reconstruct attack sequences

SOAR Integration: Automated containment actions

Incident Management: Track investigation progress

Detecting a Brute Force Attack
Normal Behavior (No Alert)
text
Events: 50 login attempts, 25 allowed, 25 denied
Metrics: deny_ratio = 0.500 (50%)
Result: ✅ Normal traffic pattern
Attack Behavior (Alert Triggered)
text
Events: 50 login attempts, 10 allowed, 40 denied  
Metrics: deny_ratio = 0.800 (80%)
Correlation: High denial rate + Multiple users + Short timeframe
Result: 🚨 BRUTE FORCE ATTACK DETECTED
Investigation Steps:
Identify Pattern: High deny ratio across multiple users

Correlate Sources: Check firewall, authentication, and network logs

Contextualize: Cross-reference with threat intelligence

Respond: Block attacking IP ranges, require MFA

Key Configuration Points
1. Threshold Tuning
bash
# Balance detection vs. false positives
THRESHOLD=0.60  # Current - good for demo
# THRESHOLD=0.70  # Production - fewer false positives
# THRESHOLD=0.50  # Sensitive - more alerts
2. Window Sizing
bash
WINDOW=50    # Current - responsive to changes
# WINDOW=200   # Production - stable, less noisy
# WINDOW=20    # Sensitive - very responsive
3. Multi-Dimensional Correlation
bash
# Enhance with additional factors:
# - Geographic anomalies
# - Time-of-day patterns  
# - Device compliance status
# - User role deviations

🎯 Conclusion
Executive Takeaway
SIEM analytics transforms your security from reactive to proactive. Instead of waiting for damage to occur, you can detect and stop threats early. Our Lesson 10 implementation demonstrates the core principles that scale to enterprise-level security operations.

Architect Insight
The patterns implemented in Lesson 10 - event collection, metric computation, threshold alerting, and correlation - form the foundation of modern security operations. These concepts directly translate to production SIEM platforms like Splunk, Azure Sentinel, and Google Chronicle.

Next Steps
Extend Data Sources: Add cloud logs, network data, endpoint telemetry

Enhance Analytics: Implement machine learning and UEBA

Automate Response: Integrate with SOAR platforms

Scale Architecture: Move to distributed processing
