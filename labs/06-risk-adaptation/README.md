# Lesson 6: Continuous Risk Adaptation & Just-In-Time Access

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Implement dynamic risk assessment with real-time adaptation
- Design Just-In-Time (JIT) access with time-bound permissions
- Create emergency override mechanisms for critical situations
- Integrate behavioral analysis and geographic controls
- Build comprehensive audit logging for all decisions

## 🔄 Continuous Risk Adaptation

### Key Features:
1. **Dynamic Risk Thresholds**: Different sensitivity levels have different risk tolerances
2. **Time-Bound Access**: JIT principles with configurable grant durations
3. **Multi-Factor Assessment**: Device, behavior, location, and risk scoring
4. **Emergency Protocols**: Override mechanisms for critical situations
5. **Automatic Revocation**: Access revoked when conditions change

### Risk Thresholds by Sensitivity:
- **Low** (public): ≤ 60 risk score
- **Medium** (internal): ≤ 40 risk score  
- **High** (confidential): ≤ 25 risk score
- **Critical** (regulated): ≤ 15 risk score

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

| Scenario | User | Risk | Sensitivity | Emergency | Expected |
|----------|------|------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Normal Access | ola | 25 | medium | ❌ | ✅ ALLOW |
| High Risk | admin | 65 | high | ❌ | ❌ DENY |
| Emergency | emergency-responder | 70 | critical | ✅ | ✅ ALLOW |
| Expired | ola | 20 | low | ❌ | ❌ DENY |
| Anomaly | jit-user | 15 | medium | ❌ | ❌ DENY |

## 🚀 Integration with Enterprise Systems

### Telemetry Sources:
- **SIEM Systems**: Splunk, Elastic, Azure Sentinel
- **Endpoint Protection**: CrowdStrike, SentinelOne
- **Identity Providers**: Okta, Azure AD Risk Engine
- **Network Analytics**: Darktrace, Vectra AI

### JIT Use Cases:
- **Privileged Access**: Temporary admin rights
- **Third-Party Access**: Vendor time-bound access
- **Emergency Response**: Break-glass procedures
- **Data Classification**: Adaptive access based on content sensitivity

## 🔒 Security Benefits

1. **Reduced Attack Surface**: Time-bound access limits exposure
2. **Adaptive Security**: Automatically responds to changing risk
3. **Audit Compliance**: Complete decision logging
4. **Operational Flexibility**: Emergency overrides when needed

## 🎯 Advanced Extensions

- **Machine Learning**: Predictive risk scoring
- **Blockchain**: Immutable audit trails
- **Federated Learning**: Cross-organization threat intelligence
- **Quantum-Resistant**: Future-proof cryptography
