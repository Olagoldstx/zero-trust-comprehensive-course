# Lesson 16: Quantum-Resistant Zero Trust Architecture

## Overview
Extend Zero Trust principles to protect against quantum computing threats while maintaining current security posture.

## Learning Objectives
- Implement quantum-resistant authentication with ECDSA-SHA384
- Deploy blockchain-based identity verification
- Establish distributed policy consensus mechanisms  
- Monitor and detect quantum computing threats
- Integrate all components into a complete Zero Trust system

## Architecture Components

### Quantum Authentication (quantum_auth.py)
- ECDSA-SHA384 for quantum-resistant signatures
- Hybrid cryptography support
- Quantum-aware policy engine

### Blockchain Identity (blockchain_identity.py) 
- Decentralized identity management
- Immutable verification records
- Identity revocation capabilities

### Policy Consensus (policy_consensus.py)
- Distributed policy approval
- Quantum-resistant voting
- Emergency policy activation

### Threat Intelligence (threat_intelligence.py)
- Quantum attack pattern detection
- Real-time threat assessment
- Automated response recommendations

### Integrated System (quantum_zero_trust_system.py)
- Combines all components
- End-to-end quantum verification
- Emergency lockdown capabilities
