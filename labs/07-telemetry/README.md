# Lesson 7: Telemetry-Driven Policy Enforcement

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Expose OPA decision metrics via Prometheus for monitoring
- Forward audit logs to SIEM systems for security analysis
- Visualize allow/deny patterns and risk trends
- Build a complete telemetry stack for Zero Trust observability

## 📊 Telemetry Architecture

### Components:
- **OPA Policy Engine**: Makes authorization decisions with telemetry
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Real-time counters and timing metrics
- **SIEM Integration**: Security event forwarding for correlation
- **Decision Logging**: Structured audit trails for all decisions

### Key Metrics Exposed:
- `opa_decision_count`: Total decision counter
- `opa_decision_duration_seconds`: Decision latency
- `opa_bundle_*`: Policy bundle metrics
- Custom business metrics via trace logs

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start the telemetry stack:**
   ```bash
   ./forwarder.sh
Monitor metrics in real-time:

bash
./monitor_metrics.sh
🔧 Test Scenarios
Scenario	User	Risk	Device	Expected	Telemetry Reason
Normal Access	ola	25	Compliant	✅ ALLOW	low_risk_compliant_device
High Risk	admin	75	Compliant	❌ DENY	high_risk_score
Bad Device	operator	20	Non-compliant	❌ DENY	non_compliant_device
Geo Block	ola	30	Compliant	❌ DENY	geographic_restriction
🌐 SIEM Integration
Supported SIEM Systems:
Splunk: HTTP Event Collector (HEC)

Elastic Stack: Elasticsearch ingestion

Azure Sentinel: Log Analytics workspace

AWS CloudWatch: Log groups and metrics

Google Chronicle: Custom ingestion

Log Format:
json
{
  "decision_outcome": "ALLOW|DENY",
  "user": "username",
  "risk": 25,
  "reason": "low_risk_compliant_device",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
📈 Prometheus Dashboard
Key Visualizations:
Decision Rate: Requests per second by outcome

Risk Distribution: Risk score histogram

Machine Learning: Anomaly detection on decision patterns

Blockchain Audit: Immutable decision logging

🧠 Reflection

Why is decision telemetry vital in Zero Trust?

How would you correlate OPA metrics with network flows in SIEM?

Could you auto-quarantine a device if deny rate > threshold?
