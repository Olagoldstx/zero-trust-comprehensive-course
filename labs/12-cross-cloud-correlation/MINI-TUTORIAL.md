üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Basic understanding of cloud security concepts

Familiarity with JSON and command line

Completed Lessons 1-11 (recommended)

üìö Part 1: Understanding Cross-Cloud Correlation
What is Cross-Cloud Correlation?
Cross-cloud correlation means connecting security events across multiple cloud providers to detect coordinated attacks that might be invisible when looking at individual clouds.

Real-World Example:
text
üö® ATTACK SCENARIO:
- 09:00: User "attacker" fails login on AWS (Medium risk)
- 09:02: Same user "attacker" accesses sensitive Azure resource (High risk)  
- 09:05: Same user "attacker" modifies GCP IAM policies (Critical risk)

INDIVIDUAL CLOUDS: Each event might be dismissed as noise
CROSS-CLOUD VIEW: Clear coordinated attack pattern!
Key Benefits:
Reduced False Positives - Validate alerts across clouds

Early Attack Detection - Spot patterns before major damage

Comprehensive Visibility - See the full attack chain

Automated Response - Trigger actions across all clouds

üéÆ Part 2: Hands-On Lab Setup
Step 1: Verify Your Environment
bash
# Navigate to the lesson directory
cd ~/zero-trust-comprehensive-course/labs/12-cross-cloud-correlation

# Check available scripts
ls -la

# Expected output:
# generate_cloud_events.sh   - Creates synthetic cloud events
# correlate_events.sh        - Analyzes cross-cloud patterns  
# alert_correlations.sh      - Generates security alerts
Step 2: Understand the Data Model
Our system uses a unified security schema:

json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "cloud": "aws|azure|gcp",
  "user": "identity@domain", 
  "severity": 0-4,
  "message": "Security event description"
}
Severity Levels:

0-1: Low risk (Normal operations)

2-3: Medium risk (Suspicious activity)

4: High risk (Potential attack)

üî• Part 3: Generating Multi-Cloud Events
Step 3: Create Synthetic Security Events
bash
# Generate 60 multi-cloud events
./generate_cloud_events.sh

# Expected output:
# üåê Generating 60 synthetic multi-cloud events...
# ‚úÖ Generated 60 synthetic multi-cloud events ‚Üí multicloud_events.jsonl
Step 4: Examine the Generated Data
bash
# View sample events
head -5 multicloud_events.jsonl | jq .

# Count events by cloud provider
jq -sr 'group_by(.cloud) | map({cloud: .[0].cloud, count: length})' multicloud_events.jsonl

# Count events by severity  
jq -sr 'group_by(.severity) | map({severity: .[0].severity, count: length})' multicloud_events.jsonl
üìä Sample Analysis Output:

json
[
  {"cloud": "aws", "count": 20},
  {"cloud": "azure", "count": 20}, 
  {"cloud": "gcp", "count": 20}
]
üïµÔ∏è Part 4: Correlation Analysis
Step 5: Run Cross-Cloud Correlation
bash
# Analyze user behavior across clouds
./correlate_events.sh | jq .

# For pretty formatted output:
./correlate_events.sh | jq -r '
  .[] | "User: \(.user) | Clouds: \(.clouds) | Events: \(.total_events) | High Severity: \(.high_severity_count)"
'
Step 6: Understand Correlation Results
The correlation engine analyzes:

User Activity Patterns - Which users operate across multiple clouds?

Severity Distribution - How many high-risk events per user?

Temporal Patterns - When did events occur?

Risk Scoring - Calculated risk based on severity and cloud spread

üéØ Key Metrics to Watch:

is_correlated: true - User active across multiple clouds

high_severity_count - Number of critical events

risk_score - Calculated threat level (higher = more dangerous)

üö® Part 5: Anomaly Detection & Alerting
Step 7: Generate Security Alerts
bash
# Run the alerting system
./alert_correlations.sh

# Expected output includes:
# üî• CRITICAL alerts for multi-cloud attack patterns
# ‚ö†Ô∏è SUSPICIOUS alerts for cross-cloud activity
# ‚úÖ NORMAL status for low-risk users
Step 8: Analyze Alert Scenarios
Scenario A: The Obvious Attacker

text
üî• CRITICAL: Multi-cloud attack pattern detected!
   User: attacker | Clouds: [aws, azure, gcp]
   High-severity events: 13 | Total events: 13
   Risk Score: 12/100
   ‚û°Ô∏è Action: Immediate investigation required
Scenario B: Suspicious Cross-Cloud Activity

text
‚ö†Ô∏è SUSPICIOUS: Cross-cloud activity detected
   User: admin | Clouds: [aws, gcp] 
   Events: 7 across 2 clouds
   Risk Score: 45/100
   ‚û°Ô∏è Action: Enhanced monitoring
Scenario C: Normal User Behavior

text
‚úÖ NORMAL: User: guest | Clouds: [aws] | Events: 3
üß™ Part 6: Advanced Exercises
Exercise 1: Custom Event Generation
Create your own attack scenario:

bash
# Create a targeted attack pattern
for i in {1..10}; do
  jq -nc --arg ts "$(date -Is)" \
    '{timestamp:$ts,cloud:"aws",user:"malicious_user",severity:4,message:"Privilege escalation"}' \
    >> multicloud_events.jsonl
  jq -nc --arg ts "$(date -Is)" \
    '{timestamp:$ts,cloud:"azure",user:"malicious_user",severity:4,message:"Sensitive data access"}' \
    >> multicloud_events.jsonl
done

# Re-run correlation
./alert_correlations.sh
Exercise 2: Modify Alert Thresholds
Edit the alert logic in alert_correlations.sh:

bash
# Change from:
if [[ "$correlated" == "true" && "$high" -gt 0 ]]; then

# To (more sensitive):
if [[ "$correlated" == "true" && "$total" -gt 3 ]]; then
Exercise 3: Add New Cloud Provider
Extend the system for additional clouds:

bash
# In generate_cloud_events.sh, add:
clouds=("aws" "azure" "gcp" "oracle" "ibm")

# Re-generate events and test correlation
üìä Part 7: Real-World Application
Production Deployment Considerations
Data Ingestion Pipeline:

yaml
aws:
  source: cloudwatch_logs_subscription
  filter: "SecurityHubEvents"
azure:  
  source: event_grid_service_bus
  filter: "SecurityCenterAlerts"
gcp:
  source: pubsub_topics  
  filter: "SecurityCommandCenter"
Correlation Rules for SOC:

Same user, multiple clouds within 5 minutes ‚Üí Investigate

High severity + cross-cloud ‚Üí Immediate alert

IAM changes across clouds ‚Üí High priority review

Integration with Existing Tools
bash
# Send alerts to Slack
./alert_correlations.sh | grep "CRITICAL" | \
  curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"text":"üö® Multi-cloud attack detected!"}' \
  $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL

# Create Jira tickets for critical alerts  
./alert_correlations.sh | grep "CRITICAL" | \
  while read alert; do
    # Jira API integration code here
    echo "Creating ticket for: $alert"
  done
üéØ Part 8: Knowledge Check
Quiz Questions:
What does is_correlated: true indicate?

A) User has events in a single cloud

B) User has events across multiple clouds ‚úÖ

C) User has only low-severity events

Which scenario would trigger a CRITICAL alert?

A) User with 1 event in AWS

B) User with high-severity events across 3 clouds ‚úÖ

C) User with 10 low-severity events in GCP

What's the purpose of risk scoring?

A) To count total events

B) To prioritize investigation efforts ‚úÖ

C) To generate pretty reports

Hands-On Challenge:
Mission: Detect a sophisticated attacker who:

Uses different usernames across clouds

Spreads medium-severity events

Operates across all 3 cloud providers

Hint: Modify the event generator to create this pattern, then update correlation logic to detect it.

üîß Part 9: Troubleshooting Guide

Issue: "jq: command not found"

bash
# Solution: Install jq
sudo apt-get install jq  # Ubuntu/Debian
# or
brew install jq         # macOS
Issue: "Permission denied" when running scripts

bash
# Solution: Make scripts executable  
chmod +x *.sh
