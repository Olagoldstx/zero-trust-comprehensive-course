## 🎯 Concept Overview

### What is SOC & SIEM Integration?
**SOC (Security Operations Center)** is your organization's security nerve center, while **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** is the system that collects and analyzes security data from across your infrastructure.

**Zero-Trust SOC Integration** means streaming policy decisions from your zero-trust systems (like OPA) to your SIEM, enabling real-time security monitoring and automated response.

### Why This Matters?
- **Visibility**: See every access decision across your organization
- **Compliance**: Prove that security policies are being enforced
- **Incident Response**: Detect and respond to threats faster
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain complete records for investigations

## 🚀 Beginner's Guide

### Prerequisites Checklist
- [ ] Basic understanding of APIs and web services
- [ ] Familiarity with terminal/command line
- [ ] Node.js installed on your system
- [ ] OPA (Open Policy Agent) binary available

### Key Terms Explained

| Term | Definition | Real-World Analogy |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| **OPA** | Open Policy Agent - makes access decisions | Like a bouncer at a club checking IDs |
| **SIEM** | Security Information & Event Management | Like security cameras recording everything |
| **Forwarder** | Script that sends data between systems | Like a messenger delivering reports |
| **Telemetry** | Data about system operations | Like a car's dashboard showing speed and fuel |

### The Big Picture
Imagine your zero-trust system as security guards making decisions about who can enter buildings. This lab shows how to send those decision records to a central security office (SIEM) where they can be monitored and analyzed.

### Data Flow Explained
1. **Traffic Generator** creates simulated access requests
2. **OPA Engine** evaluates policies and makes allow/deny decisions  
3. **Metrics Forwarder** collects OPA statistics every 10 seconds
4. **SIEM Server** receives, stores, and analyzes security events
5. **Security Team** monitors the SIEM dashboard for anomalies

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Tutorial

### Phase 1: Environment Setup

#### Step 1: Start the SIEM Server
```bash
# Terminal 1 - This is your security monitoring center
node siem_server.js
What happens: A web server starts on port 9200 that will receive security events.

Step 2: Start the OPA Policy Engine
bash
# Terminal 2 - This is your zero-trust decision maker
opa run --server --set=decision_logs.console=true policy.rego
What happens: OPA loads the access policies and waits for decision requests.

Phase 2: Monitoring Setup
Step 3: Start the Metrics Forwarder
bash
# Terminal 3 - This is your data collector
chmod +x forward_correct.sh
./forward_correct.sh
What happens: A script starts that checks OPA metrics every 10 seconds and sends them to the SIEM.

Step 4: Generate Traffic
bash
# Terminal 4 - This simulates real user activity
while true; do
  # Health check
  curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8181/health > /dev/null
  
  # User "ola" - low risk, should be allowed
  curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"input":{"user":"ola","device":{"compliant":true},"context":{"risk":25}}}' \
    http://127.0.0.1:8181/v1/data/telemetry/enforce/allow > /dev/null
  
  # User "guest" - high risk, should be denied  
  curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"input":{"user":"guest","device":{"compliant":true},"context":{"risk":75}}}' \
    http://127.0.0.1:8181/v1/data/telemetry/enforce/allow > /dev/null
  
  sleep 2
done
Phase 3: Verification
Step 5: Test the System
bash
# Check SIEM is healthy
curl http://localhost:9200/health

# View collected security events
curl http://localhost:9200/events

# Get statistics
curl http://localhost:9200/stats

# Test a policy decision manually
curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":{"user":"ola","device":{"compliant":true},"context":{"risk":25}}}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8181/v1/data/telemetry/enforce/allow
🧠 Advanced Concepts
Policy-as-Code Deep Dive
The policy.rego file implements sophisticated access control:

rego
# Default: deny all access (zero-trust principle)
default allow = false

# User "ola" - trusted employee, higher risk tolerance
allow {
    input.user == "ola"
    input.device.compliant        # Device must be compliant
    input.context.risk <= 50      # Medium risk acceptable
}

# User "guest" - external user, strict controls
allow {
    input.user == "guest" 
    input.device.compliant        # Device must be compliant
    input.context.risk <= 30      # Only low risk acceptable
}
Event Enrichment Strategy
We enhance raw metrics with context:

json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-07T10:41:16-07:00",
  "source": "zero-trust-opa",
  "event_type": "http_metrics",
  "data": {
    "total_requests": "12096",
    "metric_type": "http_request_duration_seconds",
    "collection_time": "2025-10-07T10:41:16-07:00"
  }
}
Enrichment Benefits:

Timestamps: For timeline analysis

Source Identification: Know which system generated the event

Structured Data: Easy querying and correlation

Context: Understand what the numbers mean

Scaling Patterns
Horizontal Scaling
bash
# Multiple OPA instances behind load balancer
opa run --server :8181 policy.rego &
opa run --server :8182 policy.rego &
opa run --server :8183 policy.rego &
High Availability SIEM
bash
# Multiple SIEM receivers for redundancy
node siem_server.js --port 9200 &
node siem_server.js --port 9201 &
🔧 Troubleshooting Guide
Common Issues and Solutions
Issue: "Cannot use import statement outside a module"
Solution: Ensure package.json has "type": "module" or convert to CommonJS syntax.

Issue: OPA metrics not showing
Solution:

bash
# Check OPA is running
curl http://127.0.0.1:8181/health

# Generate some traffic to create metrics
curl http://127.0.0.1:8181/v1/data/telemetry/enforce/allow
Issue: SIEM not receiving events
Solution:

bash
# Test SIEM connectivity
curl http://localhost:9200/health

# Check forwarder script permissions
chmod +x forward_correct.sh
Debugging Steps
Check all services are running (ps aux | grep -E "node|opa")

Test connectivity between components

Verify file permissions on scripts

Check for port conflicts (netstat -tulpn | grep -E "8181|9200")

🏭 Production Readiness
Enterprise Integration Patterns
Real SIEM Integration
bash
# Example: Send to Splunk HTTP Event Collector
curl -k https://splunk-server:8088/services/collector/event \
  -H "Authorization: Splunk YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"event": {"message": "Zero-trust policy violation", "user": "attacker"}}'
Alerting Rules
javascript
// Example alert condition
if (event.severity === "HIGH" && event.user === "unknown") {
  triggerAlert("Potential intrusion attempt");
}
