## 🧱 Week 1 — Core Concepts & Mindset  

### 🎯 Goal
Shift from perimeter thinking (“castle and moat”) to continuous verification.

### 🧩 Analogy
**Traditional Security** = a castle & moat. Once you’re inside, free access everywhere.  
**Zero Trust** = an airport. Even with a boarding pass, you re-verify at every gate.

### 📖 Day 1 – Understand “Never Trust, Always Verify”
- Everything — users, devices, workloads — must prove identity and health.
- Verification isn’t one-time; it’s continuous.
