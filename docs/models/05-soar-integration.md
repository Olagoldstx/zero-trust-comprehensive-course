# Lesson 11 â€” Automated Response & Adaptive Access (SOAR Integration)

We connect SIEM alerts to automated response logic and dynamically tune policy states.

## Objectives
- Watch deny_ratio signals and trigger actions automatically.
- Modify OPA policy state based on live telemetry.
- Build a feedback loop between analytics and enforcement.

## How to Run
```bash
opa run --server --addr :8181 --set prometheus=true
labs/11-soar-integration/response_engine.sh
labs/11-soar-integration/adaptive_policy.sh
labs/10-siem-analytics/generate_events.sh
Reflection
What's the risk of false positives triggering restricted mode?

How could you escalate to human review before lockdown?

Would you integrate external playbooks (e.g., AWS Lambda, Slack alerts, PagerDuty)?
