üß© Core Concepts
1. Cross-Cloud Correlation
Identifying attack patterns that span multiple cloud environments, where individual cloud alerts might be dismissed as noise but together reveal coordinated campaigns.

2. Unified Security Schema
Normalizing disparate cloud log formats into a common structure for consistent analysis:

json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "cloud": "aws|azure|gcp",
  "user": "identity@domain",
  "severity": 0-4,
  "message": "Normalized event description",
  "resource": "arn/uri",
  "action": "api-action"
}
3. Risk-Based Alerting
Scoring security events based on multiple factors:

Cross-cloud presence

Event severity and frequency

Temporal patterns

Identity confidence

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
Event Generation & Simulation
bash
# Generate synthetic multi-cloud events
./labs/12-cross-cloud-correlation/generate_cloud_events.sh

# Output: 60+ events across AWS, Azure, GCP
# Includes realistic attack patterns for testing
Correlation Analysis
bash
# Analyze cross-cloud patterns
./labs/12-cross-cloud-correlation/correlate_events.sh

# Output: JSON correlation analysis grouped by user
Alert Generation
bash
# Generate security alerts based on correlation
./labs/12-cross-cloud-correlation/alert_correlations.sh

# Output: Human-readable alerts with risk scoring
üéì Mini-Tutorial: Build Your Cross-Cloud SOC
Step 1: Generate Baseline Activity
bash
./labs/12-cross-cloud-correlation/generate_cloud_events.sh
Step 2: Analyze Correlation Patterns
bash
./labs/12-cross-cloud-correlation/correlate_events.sh | jq .
Step 3: Identify Anomalies
bash
./labs/12-cross-cloud-correlation/alert_correlations.sh
Expected Output:

üîê Security Architect Perspective
Design Patterns
Facade Pattern: Unified interface for disparate cloud APIs

Observer Pattern: Real-time event monitoring across clouds

Strategy Pattern: Cloud-specific normalization logic

Correlator Pattern: Multi-source event correlation

Compliance & Governance
Cross-cloud compliance mapping (SOC2, ISO27001, etc.)

Unified audit trail for regulatory requirements

Data residency and sovereignty enforcement

Incident response playbooks for multi-cloud scenarios

üöÄ Advanced Exercises
