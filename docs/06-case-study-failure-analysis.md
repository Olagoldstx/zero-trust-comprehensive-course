# Case Study & Failure Analysis

> *Learning from Real-World Implementations*

## Successful Implementations

### Case Study 1: Financial Services
**Challenge**: Legacy perimeter-based security insufficient for cloud migration
**Solution**: Implemented Zero Trust with micro-segmentation
**Results**: 70% reduction in security incidents, faster cloud adoption

### Case Study 2: E-commerce Platform  
**Challenge**: API security breaches affecting customer data
**Solution**: API-level Zero Trust with OPA policies
**Results**: Eliminated API-based attacks, improved compliance

## Common Failure Patterns

### 1. Overly Complex Policies
**Problem**: Policies become too complex to maintain
**Solution**: Start simple, iterate based on actual traffic

### 2. Cultural Resistance
**Problem**: Teams resist "always verify" model
**Solution**: Education and gradual rollout

## Lessons Learned
- Start with pilot projects
- Involve development teams early
- Monitor both security and user experience
